# Challenge

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Web Developer/Designer final project!

If you're reading this, you've been selected to participate in building a project to distinguish yourself from other applicants and demonstrate your development skills. Congratulations on making it to this exciting stage in the process!

This project is meant to take 10-20 hours of development, or approximately 5-7 days. If at any time you're unable complete the challenge, please feel free to excuse yourself - no hard feelings, no questions asked. We value your time and appreciate participation.

Should you choose to accept the challenge, not only could this lead to your next career opportunity, but also an outstanding project to showcase on Github.

Okay, let's get into the challenge details!

## Requirements {#requirements}
Build a boxscore and one additional data visualization component that you think helps tell the story of an NBA game with HTML, CSS and JS.

- No CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.), just your from-scratch CSS.
- Use whatever JS framework you want
- Game detail API. [Read these docs](/docs/gameDetail).
- Responsive to a 320px minimum viewport size and larger
- Forkable from Github, with a README on how to locally view your project. If a private repo, which we would encourage during development, please add [@mkamla](https://github.com/mkamla) as a collaborator when your project is ready for review.
- Viewable in a modern web browser client.
- Timely completion of the project. Preferably 7 days from delivery of project details.

## Evaluation Criteria
Aside from adherence to the [requirements](#requirements), below are specific aspects that will be evaluated:
- UI components are styled coherently and not disjointed from one another, with care taken on design principals (color, shape, space, line, typography, etc.)
- Boxscore and visualization components handle differing game states and general error handling gracefully
- Boxscore and visualization components clearly and accurately communicate game information

### Bonus Points
Additional consideration will be given to projects that demonstrate a firm grasp of the statistical storytelling of an NBA game, polished UI/UX with judicious and discerning use of advanced styling techniques (should you choose to use them), and creativity in incorporating resources that are additive to the project requirements and reside outside the scope of this document.

The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is a little _extra_.

## Submission
Please send an email when your project is available on Github (don't forget the repo link!). A follow up email will be sent to schedule a time to review your project.
