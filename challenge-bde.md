# Challenge

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Backend Data Engineer final project!

If you're reading this, you've been selected to participate in a technical project to distinguish yourself from other applicants and demonstrate your data engineering skills. Congratulations on making it to this exciting stage in the process!

This project is meant to take 6-8 hours, or approximately 3-4 days. If at any time you're unable complete the challenge, please feel free to excuse yourself - no hard feelings, no questions asked. We value your time and appreciate participation.

Should you choose to accept the challenge, not only could this lead to your next career opportunity, but also an outstanding project to showcase on your resume.

Okay, let's get into the challenge details!

## Overview
The Houston Rockets collect a wide range of data including ticket transactions, retail sales, and fan surveys. However, this data comes from various sources with differing formats, making it difficult to truly understand who our fans are and track how theyâ€™re interacting with the Houston Rockets.

Use the available data sources to create a unified database table (i.e., a single table that our Business Intelligence & Innovation team could leverage to build fan segments and determine their behaviors). 

## Requirements
Using your programming method of choice, create a unified database table that could be used as the basis for dashboards and reporting on fan segments and their behaviors.

At minimum, the database table should include the following:

- A unique identifier for each fan as the primary key
- Fan identifiers from each data source
- Fields containing contact information for each fan (email, phone number, and zip code)
- The following calculated fields:
	- Number of ticket transactions
	- Number of retail transactions
	- Number of survey responses
- At least four additional calculated fields. For example:
	- Average ticket price for each fan
	- Fan total spend
- Project is available on Github, or similar SVN service, with a README on how to locally view and/or run your project. If a private repo, which we would encourage, please add [@mkamla](https://github.com/mkamla) as a collaborator when your project is ready for review.
- Timely completion of the project. Preferably no more than *7 days from delivery of project details*.

## Evaluation Criteria
Aside from adherence to the [requirements](#requirements), below are specific aspects that will be evaluated:
- Inclusion of supporting files, documentation and scripts used to generate the unified table
- Thoughtful consideration to datapoints that are relevant to a sports, entertainment and/or event business

### Bonus Points
Additional consideration will be given to projects that include details about your methodology or approach, insights uncovered, supplemental tables and creativity in incorporating external resources that are additive to the project requirements and may reside outside the scope of this document.

The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is a little _extra_.
